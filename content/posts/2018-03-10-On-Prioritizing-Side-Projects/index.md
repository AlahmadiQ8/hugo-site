There are many things I want to do in my free time. These can be anything from programming projects, exploring new hobbies, or simply reading a book. However, whenever I attempt to get my hands dirty on a project, I often end up not completing it.  Like many people, I struggle with wasting too much time on TV, social media, or just hanging out. 

As a front end web developer, I‚Äôve been wanting to build a portfolio of my work for my personal website. I thought I had enough existing projects to display, but it turns out most of them are half-baked abandoned projects. I sometime get disappointed in myself, but this forces me to examine my habits and try to understand why I never complete side projects. I decided to take a closer look at my task management outside of work, and I have been experimenting with different strategies to balance having fun and working on side projects. 

In this post, I‚Äôll focus on what I‚Äôve learned about how to prioritize which projects to work on. I believe that choosing and prioritizing projects is an essential part of task management. Here are 3 questions I ask myself when I decide what to work on:

# 1. Does it contribute to my professional & personal growth?

I want to dedicate more time for side projects that help me learn a new skill. For example, I want to learn more about web animations, state management, websockets, and so forth. This could come in the form of learning a new skill, taking an online course, or building an application that I‚Äôd want to use. 

# 2. Does it solve a specific problem?

I want to get more practice on building and shipping products. I find myself motivated best when I work on something that solves an actual, specific problem, rather than just ‚Äúpracticing‚Äù on something theoretical. It helps me stay focused and also learn something new along the way. 

# 3. How passionate am I about it? 

Committing to a project has been one of my biggest problems. It‚Äôs hard to commit to a side project when it doesn‚Äôt pay. But I‚Äôd be more productive and invest more of my time and energy working on something I‚Äôm passionate about. So when I prioritize what projects to work on, I like to assign each of them an enthusiasm rating. I was inspired to do that based on [the Hatch Notebook](https://www.amazon.com/Hatch-Notebook-Organizer-Sketchbook-Productivity/dp/B01M7X5KTL).

# The Results

Using the questions above, here are some things I picked to work on after work:

- **Revamp and polish my personal website**. I wanted to increase my marketability by having a stronger online presence to display my work; I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with my current website so I chose to rebuild my site from scratch with [Gohugo](https://gohugo.io/).
- **Create a Connect-4 Game**. At my current job, we use Redux for application state management. Redux can have a steep learning curve, so I picked a random game to build. You can check out the final project at [this link](https://alahmadiq8.github.io/connect-4/). 
- **Build a new feature for Wunderlist**. As an example of something that solves a specific problem, I built a simple API consumer for the Wunderlist to-do app that adds todo tasks in bulk from a line separated list of tasks. This was a missing feature I needed. You can check the end result at [this link](https://wunderlist-parser.herokuapp.com/). I had so much joy working on this since it helped me solve a problem that I was having with the app.
