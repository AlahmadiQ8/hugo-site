# What I Do

I love creating great web experiences for customers. I am mostly focused on front-end technologies, specifically react and redux. I work closely with UX teams to build front-end applications. I occasionally dabble with backend in nodejs and rails. I also enjoy exploring web animations with GSAP and CSS. I have also previously done a lot of test automation in Python for hardware network devices. 

Before joining Procore, I worked at ElephantDrive, a cloud backup company, as a developer support engineer. Thatâ€™s where I found my passion for the work I do now focusing on application development.  I started my career interning at Southern California Edison as a Communications Engineer. Later I worked as a test engineer at Canoga Perkins. I received my Bachelorâ€™s at Oregon State University and my Masterâ€™s from UCLA, both in electrical engineering.

# Who I Am

Iâ€™m from Kuwait ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¼. I came to the States for college and ended up working here. I visit home at least twice a year. I wish I had the privilege to visit more often. Here is a pic of me with my twin brother and cousin in downtown Kuwait.

# Beside Work

Outside of work, I like making cute web animations and exploring open source projects. I also love musicâ€¦ but you have to know me pretty well if you ever want to catch me singing or dancing!

# Work With Me

Iâ€™m always looking for freelance opportunities to work on cool projects broaden my skillset. Iâ€™m also open to non-profit and volunteer opportunities for good causes.

Beside companies and startups, Iâ€™m also open to help small businesses and individuals setting up their websites. Check out my latest gig setting up a [Squarespace website for Parker Matthews]({{< relref "2018-02-01-parker-matthews" >}}).
